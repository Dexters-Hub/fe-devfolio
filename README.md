# (Frontend Task <> 2586 Labs)

My approach towards the tasks were to simply focus on what can i actually do best with - That's why i started with Task 2 and then Task 1. There were many details that I have missed out, and recongized during the information gathering.

It was really fun to do these challengs, and I'm really glad that i have done what i could within a few days.

## Results
